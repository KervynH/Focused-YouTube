# Focused YouTube

This is a user-script that reduces distractions on YouTube.

**Note**: This project is now archived and no longer maintained, as Iâ€™ve switched to using the [Unhook browser extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/unhook-remove-youtube-rec/khncfooichmfjbepaaaebmommgaepoid), which offers the same functionality as this project.

## Installation

With a script manager such as tampermonkey, [click here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KervynH/Focused-YouTube/main/main.user.js) to install.

## Features

- Remove homepage suggestions
- Redirect homepage to "watch later", or "subscriptions", or "library"
- Remove all shorts in feed and redirect shorts to normal player
- Remove all algorithmic suggestions
- Remove "trending" and "explore"
- Simplify UI by removing unwanted elements
- Clean up search results
- Disable video autoplay
- Block ads (may not work)

## Customize Settings

To customize the user-script, change the values of the object `SETTINGS` at the start of the code.
